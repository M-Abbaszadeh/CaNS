I would like to acknowledge Wim-Paul Breugem and Bendiks Jan Boersma from the TU 
Delft for fruitful discussions that motivated the development of this code. 
Although written from scratch, this code was deeply influenced by an in-house 
FORTRAN code for turbulent channel flow developed by WPB.

The routines for performing global transpositions are based on the 2decomp&fft
library (http://www.2decomp.org/decomp.html). Some modifications to these
routines have been performed in the CFD code AFiD
(https://github.com/PhysicsofFluids/AFiD), and ported to this code.

Moreover, the initialization of Multi-Threaded FFTs with the FFTW guru interface
was inspired by AFiD's implementation.
